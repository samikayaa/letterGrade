# letterGrade

Let's create a project that calculates the final grade and converts it to a letter grade.

* If the final score is between 90-100, the letterGrade value should be 'A'.
* If the final score is between 80-89, the letterGrade value should be 'B'.
* If the final score is between 70-79, the letterGrade value should be 'C'.
* If the final score is between 60-69, the letterGrade value should be 'D'.
* If the final score is between 50-59, the letterGrade value should be 'E'.
* If the final score is below 50, the letterGrade value should be 'F'.
